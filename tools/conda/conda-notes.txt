Commands:
    * Environment creation: 
        Conda can create virtual environments with seperate python version along with basic python packages
            command: conda create -p venv python==3.12
                     * venv is the environment name here
                     
    * Environment activation using conda:
        Go to the directory where conda's venv is present
            command: conda activate venv 
                        or 
                     conda activate <absolute path of the venv directory> 

    * Packages Installation (should be performed only after environment activation using conda activate)
        In addition to this, we can also write requirements.txt file by specifying the python packages in it. Install them using the command
            command: pip install -r requirements.txt
    

    * Environment deactivation using conda:
        Go to the directory where conda's venv is present
            command: conda deactivate 

            e.g.,   ai-temp $ conda activate venv/
                    (/private/tmp/ai-temp/venv) ai-temp $ conda deactivate
                    ai-temp $
