Commands:
    * Project creation:
        uv init <project-name>
        - we can also mention the python version in the command 
    
    * Vurtual environment creation:
        cd <uv-project-folder>
        uv venv 

    * python packages installation:
        uv add <python package> 

        This installs the packages and updates the packages and their versions so that we need to write the requirements.txt again to note down what all we have installed.
